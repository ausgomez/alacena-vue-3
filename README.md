# Food Recipes with what you have at hand üë®‚Äçüç≥

## Description

Are you stuck and bored at your house trying to find new thing ways to kill your time?

Well, I invite you to try cooking for fun, and do not worry about buying stuff outside, this app will help you to find recipes with what you have at your fridge or "alacena" (cupboard in Spanish). No download or annoying ads, just open the link with your phone, and you will be ready to start. Give it a try, it is totally free.

But remember to share your "food experiments" with your family and friends.

## How I built it

The project is using Vue.js 3, I wanted to give it a try since I have only used the 2.x version, I am also using for the CSS front-end tailwindcss, and for the API calls I am using spoonacular API, which is amazing and provides a lot of recipes from different website.
